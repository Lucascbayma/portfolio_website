            <p class="project1_subt">The project was developed in the subject "Projetos 1", a very important college course to take</br> 
                the first steps into the world of innovation.The main theme is Accessibility and Games, in which several groups</br>
                with disabilities were mentioned. My group and I had the honor of working with the group of hearing-impaired</br> 
                people, who, unfortunately, have to face a major barrier in the world of physical and digital games. For this, we</br> 
                developed a playful game with Arduino and RFID, initially designed for children, in which cards are available divided</br> 
                by difficulties (Easy, Medium, and Hard) and categories (days of the week, numbers, objects, and animals) to facilitate</br> 
                and increasingly enhance the interaction with people who belong to the mentioned group. During the presentation,</br>
                we could see how the audience interacted in such a positive way and, from a prototype, already learned a little more</br> 
                about LIBRAS (Brazilian Sign Language).

            <h1 class="project2_title"> Onde está meu bigode? </h1>
            <p class="project2_subt">The game was developed by me and two other college friends in the subject "Introduction to Computing",</br> 
                where we were able to explore the no-code game creation tool "Bitsy" and our artistic skills working with pixel art</br>
                and if-else mechanisms, where a room's door could only be opened when the key was found! The game features several</br> 
                sprites and easter eggs about our professor from the subject. The goal is to find the main character's mustache, which</br>
                is a striking characteristic, and in the end, he is faced with an unexpected surprise!</br>
